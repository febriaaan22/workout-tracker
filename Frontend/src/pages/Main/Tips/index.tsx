              Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 50% to 70% of your body weight. Your body depends on water to survive.
              <br />
              Lack of water can lead to dehydration â€” a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired.
